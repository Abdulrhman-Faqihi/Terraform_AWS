# Terraform_AWS

I built this project to create a Resource on AWS cloud using EC2 instances, RDS, Load Balancer. I found Terraform(https://www.terraform.io) to be the best tool to create a Resource quickly with one command ðŸš€.

## Requirements Before Running
1- Make sure you have the terrafrom tools installed on your machine.

2- Add your Access key, Secret key and Key Pair name on line 3 and 4.

3- Make sure your IAM user has right permission to creating EC2, VPC, Route Table, Security Group and Internet Gateway.

## Running the Script
After doing the requirements, you are ready now, start clone the repo to your machine:
``` shell
git clone https://github.com/Abdulrhman-Faqihi/Terraform_AWS.git
cd Terraform_AWS/
```
Now execute terraform commands:
``` shell
terraform init
terraform plan #to show what going to build
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

## Accessing Your Cluster
* You can access your cluster by accessing the master node throw <b>ssh</b>, you can get the public IP of master node from terrform outputs. Below is example of ssh command:
``` shell
ssh -i <Your_Key_Piar> ec2-user@<MasterNode_Public_IP>
```

## Removing and Destroying AWS Resources
To destroy the hole resources that created after applying the script, just run the following command:
```shell
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```
